# Concepts

Cool, we have walk through some examples and have first-hand experience on how Runflow is used.

Let's take a break and refresh some concepts.

## Flow

A flow is a series of tasks that are performed in order.

Runflow has a dependency graph of your flow and guarantees the tasks are run when the dependent tasks runs are successful.

## Task

A task is actual work.

In general, each task is performing a logical step in your flow.

## Variable

A variable is a configurable value.

A flow may accept some variables.
